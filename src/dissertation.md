# Introduction

## Object

This dissertation primarily addresses the critical issue of accurate galaxy redshift estimation. Galaxy redshifts are pivotal in modern astronomy, providing crucial insights into cosmic distances, universe evolution, and more. The topic is of significant interest and relevance within the field.

## Purpose and Objectives

The main goal of this dissertation is to advance galaxy redshift estimation by applying advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The objective is evaluating the performance and accuracy of a trained CNN model in predicting galaxy redshifts with the aim to understand the practical applications of this model in astronomical research.

## Methodology

The methodology of this dissertation involves designing, training, and evaluating the performance of a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN is trained on a dataset of galaxy spectra sourced from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission which came already preprocessed and cleaned, ready for model training. The CNN is then trained on the dataset and evaluated on a test set of galaxy spectra.

# Background

## Gaia space obvservatory

The Gaia mission is a European Space Agency (ESA) space observatory that has been in operation since 2013. The primary goal of the mission is to create a three-dimensional map of our galaxy by measuring the positions, distances, and motions of over two billion stars.

At its core, Gaia is equipped with two optical telescopes accompanied by three scientific instruments, which collaborate to accurately ascertain the positions and velocities of stars. Additionally, these instruments disperse the starlight into spectra, facilitating detailed analysis.

Throughout its mission, the spacecraft executes a deliberate rotation, systematically scanning the entire celestial sphere with its two telescopes. As the detectors continuously record the positions of celestial objects, they also capture the objects' movements within the galaxy, along with any alterations therein.

During its mission, Gaia conducts approximately 14 observations each year for its designated stars. Its primary goals include accurately mapping the positions, distances, motions, and brightness variations of stars. Gaia's mission is expected to uncover various celestial objects, including exoplanets and brown dwarfs, and thoroughly study hundreds of thousands of asteroids within our Solar System. Additionally, the mission involves studying over 1 million distant quasars and conducting new assessments of Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.

## Galaxy redshift

Galaxy redshift is a fundamental astronomical property that describes the relative motion of a galaxy with respect to Earth. The redshift of a galaxy is measured by analyzing the spectrum of light emitted by the galaxy, which appears to be shifted towards longer wavelengths due to the Doppler effect. Redshift is a crucial parameter in astronomy, as it provides information about the distance, velocity, and evolution of galaxies.

The redshift of a galaxy is measured in units of "$z$", which is defined as the fractional shift in the wavelength of light emitted by the galaxy. Specifically, the redshift "$z$" is defined as:

$$z = \frac{\lambda_{obsv} - \lambda_{emit}}{\lambda_{emit}}$$

where $\lambda_{obsv}$ is the observed wavelength of light from the galaxy, and $\lambda_{emit}$ is the wavelength of that same light as emitted by the galaxy. A redshift of $z=0$ corresponds to no shift in the wavelength (i.e., the observed and emitted wavelengths are the same), while a redshift of $z=1$ corresponds to a shift of 100% in the wavelength (i.e., the observed wavelength is twice as long as the emitted wavelength).

Accurate and efficient estimation of galaxy redshift is essential for a wide range of astronomical studies, including galaxy formation and evolution, large-scale structure of the universe, and dark matter distribution. However, measuring galaxy redshifts can be a challenging task due to various factors such as observational noise, instrumental effects, and variations in galaxy spectra.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that has proven to be highly effective for tasks involving image and video analysis, such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. CNNs are inspired by the structure and function of the visual cortex in animals, which contains specialized cells called neurons that are tuned to detect specific visual features. In a similar way, CNNs are designed to learn and extract meaningful visual features from raw image data.

At the core of a CNN are individual processing units called neurons, which are organized into layers. Each neuron receives input from other neurons in the previous layer, applies a mathematical operation to that input, and passes the output to the next layer. The output of the final layer of neurons is the predicted output of the network for a given input.

The key innovation of CNNs is their use of convolutional layers, which enable the network to automatically learn and extract local spatial features from raw input data. In a convolutional layer, each neuron is connected only to a small, localized region of the input data, known as the receptive field. By sharing weights across all neurons within a receptive field, the network can efficiently learn to detect local patterns and features, regardless of their location within the input image.

CNNs typically also include pooling layers, which downsample the output of the previous layer by taking the maximum or average value within small local regions. This helps to reduce the dimensionality of the input and extract higher-level features from the local features learned in the previous convolutional layer.

The final layers of a CNN are fully connected layers, which take the outputs of the previous convolutional and pooling layers and use them to make a prediction. In the case of image classification, for example, the output of the final fully connected layer might be a vector of probabilities indicating the likelihood of each possible class. In our case, instead of class probabilities, the output of the final fully connected layer will yield a single numeric value representing the predicted redshift of the observed galaxy.

# Data Preparation

## Data source

The data used for this dissertation is a combination of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 (SDSS DR16) and the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) datasets. Combined, they form a dataset of galaxies with known redshifts and spectra.

## Data composition

The dataset consists of 520.000 galaxy spectra, each with 186 data points. Each data point is the flux at a specific wavelength, ranging from 366 to 996 nanometers. The dataset also contains the redshift of each galaxy, ranging from 0 to 0.6 $z$. which is the target variable that we aim to predict.

## Data preprocessing

The dataset was already cleaned. The only preprocessing step that was performed was to to apply a min-max normalization to the flux values, which rescales the flux values to the range $[0, 1]$. This is a common preprocessing step for neural networks, as it helps to improve model performance and training stability.
Min-max normalization is defined as:
$$x_{norm} = \frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}$$
where $x$ is the original data and $x_{min}$ and $x_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum values of $x$, respectively.

## Data splitting

The dataset was split into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set contained 90% of the data, while the test set contained the remaining 10%. The training set was used to train the neural network, while the test set was used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Of the training set, 30% was used as a validation set, which was used to evaluate the model during training and tune the model's hyperparameters.
